# Super Tidy
*A Figma plugin to easily align, rename and reorder your frames based in their canvas position.*

Super Tidy renames your frames and reorders them in the layers list by their position in the canvas. It also replicates the Figma Tidy feature so you can run it all at once: Rename, Reorder and Tidy.
