### Countdown Monetization Plan (Gumroad One‑Time License, Client‑Only)

#### Goal
- Introduce a countdown gate (random 6–15s) before executing any command for unlicensed users, with an in-UI option to purchase and skip the delay.
- Licensed customers experience zero delay.
- Payments handled via a Gumroad product (one-time); license activation is client-only via Gumroad License Verification API with Netlify Function proxy for secure API operations.

---

### User Experience
- **Licensed user**
  - Launch any command (including menu commands) → runs immediately, no countdown.
- **Unlicensed user**
  - Launch any command → countdown appears within the Actions view showing:
    - Animated analog chronometer with dynamic ticks
    - Digital timer countdown
    - "Get Super Tidy Pro" button → navigate to License tab for purchase/activation
    - "Run Now" button (disabled until countdown completes)
  - Options:
    - Wait until countdown completes → "Run Now" button enables, click to execute command
    - Click "Get Super Tidy Pro" → go to License tab, purchase on Gumroad, activate with license key
    - If purchase is canceled → return to countdown state
- **License Management**
  - Dedicated "License" tab in toolbar for activation, viewing license info, and unlinking
  - 2-device usage limit enforced via Gumroad's usage count system
  - License info displays email, license key, activation date, and device usage (X/2 devices)

---

### Trigger and Timing Guarantees
- Countdown appears only after a user explicitly triggers a command (UI form submission or menu command).
- Command execution is deferred until countdown completes and user manually clicks "Run Now".
- Treat the countdown as an interstitial gate between invocation and execution; the command is queued and runs only upon manual proceed.
- Closing the plugin/countdown before proceed means the command does not run.
- Applies to all commands: UI form actions and direct menu commands. Licensed users bypass the gate entirely.

---

### Technical Architecture (Final Implementation)

#### **Core Architecture Principles**
- **Embedded Countdown**: Countdown is a state within FormView.js, not a separate route
- **Clean Separation**: UI logic in UI layer, Figma APIs in Core.js
- **Direct Communication**: UI components use direct method calls, postMessage only for Core.js communication
- **License Caching**: License status cached in memory for fast gate decisions

#### **Component Responsibilities**

**FormView.js** (Primary gating component):
- Contains all countdown state and rendering logic
- Handles form submission with license gate checks
- Manages countdown timer and analog chronometer
- Renders either form or countdown based on `showingCountdown` state
- Supports both UI-initiated and direct (menu) countdowns via callback parameter
- Imports and displays AnalogChronometer component

**Core.js** (Pure Figma APIs):
- Handles Figma Canvas and Storage APIs only
- Manages license storage in `figma.clientStorage` (`LICENSE_V1` key)
- Wraps menu commands with `ensureDirectCommandGate` for gating
- Sends `start-direct-countdown` messages to UI for menu-initiated commands
- Processes license-related messages: `get-license`, `activate-license`, `remove-license`

**App.js** (Minimal orchestrator):
- Handles Core.js messages and initializes views
- `handleDirectCountdown` navigates to FormView and calls startCountdown directly
- Router setup excludes countdown route (no longer needed)
- Removed CountdownView import and rendering from App.js
- Direct integration with FormView's embedded countdown functionality

**LicenseView.js** (License management):
- Dual-state rendering: unlicensed form vs licensed info display
- Gumroad API integration via Netlify Function proxy
- 2-device usage limit enforcement
- License validation, activation, and unlinking
- Device usage tracking and display

**AnalogChronometer.js** (Visual countdown):
- Animated analog clock with red needle
- Dynamic tick generation based on total seconds
- Attribute-based updates (`total-seconds`, `current-seconds`)
- Clean white circle design with red accents

#### **Gating Flow**
1. User triggers command (UI form or menu)
2. Check cached license status via `shouldShowCountdown()`
3. **If licensed**: Execute command immediately
4. **If unlicensed**: 
   - FormView shows countdown state (embedded, not separate route)
   - User stays on "Actions" tab throughout countdown
   - After countdown: "Run Now" button enables
   - User clicks "Run Now" to execute command

#### **Menu Command Gating**
- Core.js wraps menu commands with `ensureDirectCommandGate`
- Shows UI and sends `start-direct-countdown` message
- App.js calls FormView.startCountdown with callback
- Callback sends `direct-countdown-complete` message back to Core.js
- Licensed users get `figma.closePlugin()` immediately

---

### Gumroad Integration (Client + Netlify Proxy)

#### **Product Setup**
- One-time product on Gumroad with Software Licensing enabled
- 2-device usage limit per license
- OAuth access token stored in `secrets.json` (server-side only)

#### **License Verification**
- **Endpoint**: `POST https://api.gumroad.com/v2/licenses/verify`
- **Client-side call** with form-encoded body:
  - `product_id`: Gumroad product ID  
  - `license_key`: user-entered license key
  - `increment_uses_count`: 'true' (for activation)
- **Validation criteria**:
  - `success === true`
  - `purchase.refunded !== true`
  - `purchase.chargebacked !== true`
  - `uses < 2` (2-device limit)

#### **Usage Count Management**
- **Increment**: Done during license verification (`increment_uses_count: 'true'`)
- **Decrement**: Via Netlify Function proxy at `https://figma-plugins-display-network.netlify.app/api/licenses/decrement_uses_count`
  - **Method**: PUT with JSON body
  - **Auth**: Server-side OAuth token (secure)
  - **Used for**: License unlinking to free up device slots

#### **Local Storage Schema**
- **Key**: `LICENSE_V1` in `figma.clientStorage`
- **Value**:
  ```json
  {
    "licensed": true,
    "productId": "string",
    "licenseKeyHash": "string",
    "deviceId": "string", 
    "activatedAt": 1234567890,
    "purchase": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "id": "purchase_id"
    },
    "uses": 1
  }
  ```

---

### Network Access & Security

#### **Manifest Configuration**
```json
{
  "networkAccess": {
    "allowedDomains": [
      "https://api.gumroad.com",
      "https://*.amplitude.com", 
      "https://figma-plugins-display-network.netlify.app/"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### **Security Measures**
- OAuth access token never exposed to client-side code
- License keys hashed before storage (`hashLicenseKey` function)
- Sensitive API calls proxied through Netlify Functions
- 2-device limit prevents unlimited license sharing

---

### UI/UX Implementation Details

#### **Countdown Visual Design**
- **Container**: Centered layout within FormView, maintains "Actions" tab active state
- **Analog Chronometer**: White circle, red needle, dynamic ticks for each second
- **Digital Timer**: Tabular numbers, positioned over chronometer  
- **Buttons**: "Run Now" (disabled until complete), "Get Super Tidy Pro" (always enabled)
- **Copy**: "Get Super Tidy Pro to skip the countdown" with lifetime purchase messaging

#### **License Tab**
- **Unlicensed State**: Input field, "Activate" button, validation messaging
- **Licensed State**: License info display, device usage counter, "Unlink License" button
- **Support**: Link to Google Form for assistance

#### **Navigation Behavior**
- Countdown embedded in FormView keeps user on "Actions" tab
- No "ghost screen" - user always sees familiar navigation
- License tab accessible during countdown for immediate activation

### Implementation History & Lessons Learned

#### **Architecture Evolution**
1. **Initial**: Countdown as separate route with Router navigation
2. **Refined**: Gating moved from Core.js to FormView.js for clean separation
3. **Final**: Countdown embedded within FormView as state, not separate route
4. **Latest**: Removed Router dependency, App.js directly calls FormView countdown methods

#### **API Integration Challenges**
1. **Gumroad CORS**: Client-side `decrement_uses_count` blocked by security policies
2. **Solution**: Netlify Function proxy for authenticated endpoints
3. **Content-Type**: Some endpoints require `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

#### **License Storage & Reliability Issues**
1. **Race Conditions**: FormView event listeners were accumulating without cleanup
2. **Data Consistency**: Usage count not properly stored during license activation
3. **Silent Failures**: Storage operations lacked error handling and user feedback
4. **Solution**: Implemented proper event listener cleanup, comprehensive error handling, and consistent data format

#### **Key Technical Decisions**
- **Memory over Storage**: License status cached in `gate.js` for performance
- **Direct Method Calls**: Eliminated internal UI postMessage for simplicity
- **Callback Pattern**: Unified interface for UI and menu-initiated countdowns
- **State Management**: LEO Element data properties for countdown state
- **Event Listener Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks and race conditions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all storage operations with user feedback
